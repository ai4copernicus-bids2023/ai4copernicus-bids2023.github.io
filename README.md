## Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a collection of tools and methodologies that have the potential of transforming virtually all aspects of human activity. Earth observation (EO) data, including satellite and in-situ, are essential for a number of applications, covering high-impact domains as diverse as security, agriculture and health. The H2020 [AI4Copernicus project](https://ai4copernicus-project.eu) delivers a technological framework for developers and businesses to combine AI-infused tools and EO data and services in order to create high impact applications. This is further facilitated by providing a bridge between DIAS platforms and the European AI-on-Demand platform.

This tutorial will present the main technological assets AI4Copernicus brings to the table as well as its methodology and tools for linking the DIAS and AI-on-Demand platforms, through appropriately selected use-cases during a hands-on session. Indicatively, technological assets AI4Copernicus contributes to the community include the following: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pre-processing chains, Deep network for pixel-level classification of S2 patches, Probabilistic downscaling of CAMS air quality model data, and many others. In addition, AI4Copernicus contributed semantics-based tools for visualisation and discovery of complex EO data. More information can be found in the [AI4Copernicus Technical Documentation](https://ai4copernicus-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AI4Copernicus_Technical-Documentation_V5_Feb2023_cover.pdf).

The choice of the use cases for the hands-on applications will come from AI4Copernicus' rich collaborations with 3rd parties who specialise in EO applications in the fields of Security, Health, Agriculture, Climate and others, and will be consolidated nearer the time of the tutorial.

This tutorial will target EO and AI specialists and will require little IT technical background. The hands-on session will take place on the CREODIAS infrastructure and will involve the application of AI techniques on available datasets.
